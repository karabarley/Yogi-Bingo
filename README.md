# yogiBingo

Yogi Bingo is game I built using the Datamuse API, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS and SASS. This was a fun project aimed to poke some fun at yogis like me.

I used the Datamuse API to get a bank of words relating to yoga to populate the bingo sheets.

To preview the game, you may refer to the screenshots attached (snapshot 1,2,3) or download the file and play!

Namaste!
