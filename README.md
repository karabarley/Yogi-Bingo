You may find a live version of this game on at karabarleta.com/yogi
To preview the game, I have attached some screenshots (snapshot 1,2,3) for your reference.

Yogi Bingo is game I built using the Datamuse API, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS and SASS. This was a fun project aimed to poke some fun at yogis like me.

I used the Datamuse API to get a bank of words relating to yoga to populate the bingo sheets.
